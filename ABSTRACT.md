# Abstract

This work introduces a provenance-aware research framework designed to enforce
epistemic reliability, auditability, and methodological integrity across
computational workflows. Contemporary research ecosystems increasingly depend on
heterogeneous tools, opaque automation, and fragmented documentation practices,
resulting in reproducibility failures and unverifiable claims. The proposed
framework establishes a deterministic, provenance-first architecture that
captures authorship, transformation history, methodological constraints, and
verification states as first-class research artifacts. It integrates structured
schemas, tamper-evident logging, and workflow-level invariants to ensure that
every computational step is transparent, traceable, and defensible. The system
formalizes a methodological fingerprint that enables researchers, auditors, and
regulators to evaluate the integrity of results without relying on implicit
trust or undocumented assumptions. By unifying provenance capture, workflow
governance, and reproducibility guarantees, this framework provides a
standards-aligned foundation for high-integrity scientific computation and
serves as a reference architecture for future research OS platforms.
