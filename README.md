# Provenance-Aware Research Framework
A deterministic, provenance-first architecture for high-integrity computational
research workflows. This repository provides the reference implementation,
schemas, documentation, and reproducible artifacts associated with the
provenance-aware research framework described in the accompanying manuscript.

## Overview
Modern computational research suffers from fragmented tooling, opaque
automation, and insufficient documentation of methodological decisions. These
conditions undermine reproducibility, auditability, and epistemic reliability.
This framework introduces a structured, standards-aligned approach for capturing
provenance, enforcing workflow integrity, and generating defensible research
artifacts.

The system formalizes:
- deterministic workflow boundaries,
- tamper-evident provenance trails,
- transformation-aware metadata schemas,
- audit-ready documentation structures,
- and reproducible evaluation pipelines.

## Core Objectives
- Establish provenance as a first-class research artifact.
- Enforce methodological constraints through deterministic workflow design.
- Provide a unified architecture for reproducibility and auditability.
- Enable transparent evaluation of computational claims.
- Support regulatory, scientific, and archival requirements.
