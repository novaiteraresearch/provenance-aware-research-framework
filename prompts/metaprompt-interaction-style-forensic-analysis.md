## Abstract

This metaprompt is designed to perform forensic-level analysis of interaction
style signatures specific to an individual user. It captures, characterizes, and
formalizes the behavioral, linguistic, and structural patterns that define how
a user interacts with AI systems — enabling reproducible, defensible, and
audit-ready characterization of user-specific interaction style.

The forensic framing positions interaction style not as a general preference
profile but as an analyzable artifact subject to evidence-grade documentation
and methodological rigor.
